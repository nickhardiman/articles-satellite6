I set up and ran a compliance scan via Satellite with OpenSCAP. 
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.14/html/managing_security_compliance/index


== manual setup 

Configure Satellite for SCAP.
This is initial configuration. 

* Load bundled SCAP content into Satellite
* Load RHEL 9 SCAP content
* Load Ansible role _theforeman.foreman_scap_client_
* Override Ansible variables
* Create a compliance policy

Configure Satellite for checking a content host 

* Associate the security policy with host
* Associate the Ansible role with the host
* Check the Satellite client repository is enabled

Configure the content host

* Run the Ansible role to install and configure _foreman_scap_client_

== run a compliance scan on the content host

Check the content host.
This is a repeatable process eg. scan once a week

* Run an OpenSCAP scan
* View report

== automated setup 

Is there a ready-made playbook or series of hammer commands for this?
 (I haven't yet gone through 
@sscheib
â€™s playbook yet https://github.com/sscheib/ansible_satellite/blob/main/20_satellite_openscap.yml)

It's a connected network. Should I forget Satellite and look at Insights and console.redhat.com instead?


== Insights 

if openscap scanner is installed on a machine, this command uploads to RH console
?

insights-client   --compliance
