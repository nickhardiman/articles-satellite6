Strategy is to upgrade in a test environment, make sure everything works and then move.
But when to migrate from RHEL 8 to 9, or 9 to 10.
When to stay on an older major release and when it is time to migrate to the new one.

Moving between major versions is not patching.  
IPU (In place upgrades) can break things.

Any supported release of RHEL is tested, reliable, stable and suitable for production workloads.
Upgrade to the next version of RHEL sufficiently in advance of the previous version approaching maintenance.   

It's all about the apps. 
Applications make upgrading more complicated.  
Consider things like application life time, application strategy and application modernisation.
